Blog Redirector
========
This project is a redirect service for my personal blog. I've been blogging on Posterous for several years. When I ported the content to Blogger, I wanted to preserve all of the old links to maintain search engine love. 

This simple service redirects requests for www.gregtracy.com to blog.gregtracy.com mapping to the Blogger format for date and slug name.
